# Suppose you have $100, which you can invest with a 10% return each year. After one year, it's 100 * 1.1 = 110 dollars,
# and after two years it's 100*1.1*1.1 = 121.
# Add code to calculate how much money you end up with after 7 years, and print the result.


# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable growth_multiplier
growth_multiplier = 1.1

# Calculate result
result = 100 * 1.1**7


# Print out result
print(result)
